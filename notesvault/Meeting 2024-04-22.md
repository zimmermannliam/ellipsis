* Q: Where do the transformers fit in?
	* This task was recommended to me, but from my understanding...
	* The transformers were meant to be a simple way to summarize the ellipsis
	* Alongside this, they are meant to be a way of assessing the limitations
	* For example, what cannot be expressed using foldr1, zipWithN, etc?
* 1 Rule involving ellipsis
	* Not entirely sure what this means
	* What about this case:
```haskell
binSearch t xs = case xs of
	[]             -> False
	(x1 ... xn)    -> let k = n/2+1
		in if x[k] == t    then True
		else if x[k] > t   then binSearch t (x1 ... x[k-1])
		else                    binSearch t (x[k+1] ... xn)
```
	* It could be written as:
```haskell
binSearch t xs = case xs of
	(x1 ... xn)    -> 
	   if n == 0 then False
	   else let k = n/2+1
	       in if x[k] == t    then True
	       else if x[k] > t   then binSearch t (x1 ... x[k-1])
	       else                    binSearch t (x[k+1] ... xn)
```
* .
	* But is that really better? x1 ... x0?
	* What about x1 ... x5? I might at least leave it open.
	* If we had multi-dimensional pattern matching (not planning on doing that), what about `[[], [], [], [], []]`? Could that be matched?
	* Or just `[1,1,1,1,1,1]`?
* Nested ellipsis
	* I explained the transformer very poorly and the ellipsis made it very bad.
This is what I was going for:

```haskell
-- for one matched list
f(x[i]) <.> ... <.> f(x[k])
-- becomes
(foldr1 <.>) or (id)
	$ map f
		(ranges (x, i, k))


-- for 1-2 matched lists
f(x1[i1], x2[i2]) <.> ... <.> f(x1[k1], x2[k2])
-- becomes
(foldr1 <.>) or (id)
	$ zipWith f
		(ranges (x1, i1, k1))
		(ranges (x2, i2, k2))


-- for 1-3 matched lists
f(x1[i1], x2[i2], x3[i3]) <.> ... <.> f(x1[k1], x2[k2], x3[k3])
-- becomes
(foldr1 <.>) or (id)
	$ zipWith3 f
		(ranges (x1, i1, k1))
		(ranges (x2, i2, k2))
		(ranges (x3, i3, k3))
		
-- and so on
-- for 1-N matched lists
f(x1[i1], ..., xN[iN]) <.> ... <.> f(x1[k1], ..., xN[kN])
-- becomes
(foldr1 <.>) or (id)
	$ zipWithN f
		(ranges (x1, i1, k1))
		...
		(ranges (xN, iN, kN))
```
* .
	* The issue is that there is no simple function that summarizes ellipsis the same way as normal list comprehensions
	* Parallel list comprehensions:
		* https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/parallel_list_comprehensions.html
* Examples: map/fold/zip exist, I was showing some nontrivial examples that I liked
* I have smart constructors and all that.

idea:
```
foldr f base (x[1] ... x[n]) = x[1] `f` ... `f` x[n] `f` base
```

```
length []               = 0
length (x[1] ... x[n])  = const 1 x[1] ... const 1 x[n]
```


# Notes

* Second approach: Eliminate ellipsis patterns and expressions
* I have mini-haskell, a language defined by me, that is parsed--prettyprinted from--to correct haskell code. 
* I also have elli-haskell == (mini-haskell PLUS ellipsis) -- To compile to mini-haskell, I write a transformer to eliminate the ellipsis patterns and expressions
* `pp $ translate (my language)` should run in a haskell compiler or interpreter.
* translate :: ElliHaskell -> MiniHaskell
* formal e :: Expr : isCore (translate e) quickcheck
* Index transformation

```
xi ... xn -> x[2*i] ... x[n]
x[2*i] ... xn -> x[i] ... x[n]

	x1 ... xn -> x[1] x[3] ... x[n]

xi ... xn -> x[i `div` 2] ... x[n]
[1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4]

x1 ... xn -> (x1 ... x[n/2], x[n/2+1] ... xn)

[1,2,3,4,5,6]

x1 ... xn -> (x1 ... x1) ... (x1 ... xn)

transpose xs = case xs of
    ((x[1][1] ... x[1][m]) ...
     (x[n][1] ... x[n][m])) =>
	    ((x[1][1] ... x[n][1]) ...
	     (x[1][m] ... x[n][m]))


concat xs = case xs of
	[]          -> []
	(x1 ... xn) -> x1 ++ ... ++ xn

-- think about this one
concat xs = case xs of
	((x[1] ... x[n1]) ... (x[1] ... x[nm])) -> x[1] ... x[nm]

concatMap f xs = case xs of
	((x[1] ... x[n1]) ... (x[1] ... x[nm])) -> f x[1] ... f x[nm]


```
add:
- skipping or index transformation
