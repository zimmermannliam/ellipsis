Fair -- I appreciate the skim, though.

The consistent thing to do would be to typeset Elli-Haskell ellipses like all other concrete syntax in blue typewriter font and use mathematical ellipses without parentheses for the meta notation.  

Sounds good -- I will add `...` as a blue-highlighted keyword.

That makes sense. I was getting my notation from documents like this one:

https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs152/2010sp/lectures/lec10.pdf

Which calls definitional translation a type of denotational semantics with a target of another language. Are we doing something different?


> Third, I would also use {\cal E} instead of {\cal T}_{expr}, {\cal A} instead of {\cal T}_{alt}, etc. (i.e. try to use single letters for functions). The subscripts make the text very busy and unnecessarily hard to read.  

Will do

> Fourth, get rid of the zipWith3 and zipWith4 cases in 4.3, and use \vdots instead of 3 lines to separate zipWithN.

Will do.
