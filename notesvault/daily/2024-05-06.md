> (1) We need a concrete syntax for ellipses, and we should define it precisely using a CFG.  

I agree, I was planning on having a section for the Elli-Haskell language with a BNF.

> (2) In the concrete syntax (and abstract syntax as well), we should distinguish between ellipsis _patterns_ (which occur on the LHS of a a case rule) and ellipsis _expressions_ (which occur on the RHS of a a case rule) because they are different. E,g,, while we can have something like:  
>   
>         f x1 ... f xn  
>   
> on the RHS (i.e., as an expression), this is not a valid LHS pattern.  

I agree. My lhs patterns are currently very simple.

> (3a) I have seen you use square brackets (as in x[1] or x[n]) to separate indices from variable names. I think this is both too verbose and also clashes with list notation (see below). I suggest we use strings (starting with a lowercase) followed by numbers and single characters or index expressions enclosed in "{}". We could designate a set of variable names for indices (e.g., k, n, m) to avoid ambiguity and confusion with value variables (x, y, etc.).  

I agree, I was thinking that an Ellipsis LHS pattern [x1,...,xn], especially when used with one-letter variables, could bind x1, x2, x3, ..., x100, ..., xn. This also is a bit of a counter to the rage induced by 1-indexed lists, since this feels less like an index operator. For more complex index expressions, I was thinking about x_(expr) or x[expr], but x{expr} also works. x_{expr} is very LaTeX-y, which might be good too.

We could make x_ a function: x_ = (\i -> xi) 
x_ (k+1)

> (3b) We have several options for denoting lists. E.g.:  
>         (A) x1 ... xn  
>         (B) (x1 ... xn)  
>         (C) [x1 ... xn)  
>         (D) [x1, ..., xn)  
> There are more possibilities, but I suggest we go with (D). While it is more verbose than other options, it is closer to what is already in use and it helps avoid ambiguities when using nested ellipses and other constructs such as pairs. It also helps to distinguish "map" expressions (such as f x1 ... f xn) from "fold/aggregate" expressions (such as x1 `f` ... `f` xn).  

I think I would like A/D (assuming D is [], not [) -- [) would be interesting as a reference to interval notation, but inconvenient).

For LHS patterns, though, 

> (4) Do we have "fold/aggregate" expressions (such as x1 `f` ... `f` xn)? If so, how do we deal with associativity? How is x1 `f` ... `f` xn being parsed?

> Or:  
>          x1 `f` (... `f` xn)  {fold right}  
> Or should we require the parentheses in the concrete syntax?  

I have their implementation, but not a parser for them. I'm not sure if this is practical, but I imagined `f` ... `f` as one big token -- non-associative with the same precedence as >>=.

> (5) Can we express the following cases? If not, this is fine, but we should mention these cases then as limitations.  

I can express all of them, although not always in the same way.

> (5a) inits (the list of all initial segments of a list)  
>         inits [x1, ..., xn] = [[], [x1], [x1, x2], ..., [x1, ..., xn]]  

We can express inits, but currently as:
inits (x1...xn) = [[x1,...,x1]...[x1,...,xn]]
Your notation is a lot less confusing than mine, though. It does bring up two cases I can add to the translation:

Empty ... Ellipsis (And Ellipsis ... Empty)
Cons ... Ellipsis (And Ellipsis ... Cons)

Cons...Ellipsis will need a checker (for [xi] ... [xj...xk], is i==j? are all elements of LHS from list X? In order?) but shouldn't be too hard. I will implement that later today and update you.

Then inits can be represented as:

inits [x1...xn] = [[]] ++ [[x1],...,[x1, ..., xn]]
or, sugared:
inits [x1...xn] = [[],[x1],...,[x1, ..., xn]]
or
inits [x1...xn] = [[], ..., [x1,...,xn]]

> (5b) scanl (foldl of all initial segments of a list)  
>         scanl1 f [x1, ..., xn] = [x1, foldl1 f [x1, x2], ..., foldl1 f [x1, ..., xn]]  

yes, similar to inits:

scanl1 f [x1...xn] = [foldl1 f [x1,...,x1], ..., foldl1 f [x1, ..., xn]]

In the future:

scanl1 f [x1...xn] = [foldl1 f [x1], ..., foldl1 f [x1, ..., xn]]
or:
scanl1 f [x1...xn] = [x1,foldl1 f [x1,x2], ..., foldl1 f [x1, ..., xn]]

scanr1 has some more stuff going on:

scanr1 f [x1...xn] = [x1 `f`...`f` x1, ..., x1 `f`...`f` xn]

I would have to see if I can make a case for:
scanr1 f [x1...xn] = [x1, x1 `f` x2, ..., x1 `f`...`f` xn]
or even
scanr1 f [x1...xn] = [x1, ..., x1 `f`...`f` xn]

But I think that will be harder than 5a.

> (5c) neighbors (pairs of neighboring list elements)  
>         neighbors [x1, ..., xn] = [(x1,x2), ..., (x{n-1},xn)  

Yes, I have been calling it pairAdj. It looks exactly like your example:
pairAdj [x1...xn] = [(x1, x2), ..., (x{n-1}, xn)]

> (5d) delete/replace kth element  
>         delete k [x1, ..., xk, ..., xn] = [x1 ..., ..., xn]  
>         replace k y [x1, ..., xk, ..., xn] = [x1, ..., y, ..., xn]  

Yes, although not like your example:
delete k [x1...xn] = [x1,...,x{k-1}] ++ [x{k+1},...,xn]
Which I think can be sugared to:
delete k [x1...xn] = [x1, ..., x{k-1}, x{k+1}, ... ,xn]

replace k y [x1...xn] = [x1, ..., x{k-1}] ++ [y] ++ [x{k+1}, ..., xn]
replace k y [x1...xn] = [x1, ..., x{k-1}, y, x{k+1}, ..., xn]

My LHS patterns are currently very simple.

> Alternative syntax with additional delete/substitution pattern (delete is a special case of substitute):  
>         delete k [x1, ..., xn] = [x1, ..., /xk, ..., xn]  
>         replace k y [x1, ..., xn] = [x1, ..., y/xk, ..., xn]
