The T[[]] functions are meant to be definitional translation functions that take an Elli-Haskell expression and produce a Mini-Haskell expression.

Telli[[*,*]], as you mentioned, is meant to infer the translation from both sides of the expression.

> If that's the case, then sure, this makes sense. But why not use concrete syntax in this case? Assuming you are talking about giving a mathematical definition (translated back from the Haskell implementation), then I would use the concrete syntax and write something like this:  
>         [[ L ... R ]] s,t,u = ...  
> (Here s, t, u are parts of the context required for the translation.)  

I think both ways might make sense, but I chose not to use concrete syntax because of the way Telli "traverses" the syntax tree of both sides of the ellipsis expression.

For example:
    Texpr[[
    zipSum [x1,...,xn] [y1,...,ym] =
        let k = min n m
        in [x1+y1, ..., xk+yk]
     ]] =
     
     (...)
    
    Texpr[[ x{1}+y{1} ... x{k}+y{k} ]]
        = zipWith (\v_uniq1 v_uniq2 -> Telli[[ x{1}+y{1}, x{k}+y{k} ]])
          (listRange x 1 k)  -- taken from context
          (listRange y 1 k)  -- taken from context
Where
    Telli[[ x{1}+y{1}, x{k}+y{k} ]]
        = Telli[[ x{1}, x{k} ]] + Telli [[ y{1}, y{k} ]]
        = v_uniq1 + v_uniq2; propogate [(x, 1, k, v_uniq1), (y, 1, k, v_uniq2)]
Where
    Telli [[ x{1},x{k} ]] = v_uniq1; store (x, 1, k, v_uniq1)
    Telli [[ y{1},y{k} ]] = v_uniq2; store (y, 1, k, v_uniq2)

In syntax trees:

    (this might not display right without monospace)
    T[[ +           +
       / \         / \
      /   \       /   \
     x1   y1  ,  xk   yk
     ]] =   +
           / \
          /   \
         /     \
        /       \
    T[[x1,xk]]  T[[y1,yk]]

So T[[ x{1}...x{n} ]] is a different operation from Telli[[ x{1}, x{n} ]], because the `...` expression produce the `zipWithN` function.

Oh, I think one of our clients is stripping the formatting. I might have sent you ugly emails in the past unknowlingly as well. The reds were (el1, er1) and the blues were (el2, er2).

This can be a simple environment (i.e., set of bindings when defining semantics for lambda calculus) or a complicated structure with several components. In that case one can, of course, use a more elaborate meta-syntax for separating different components of the context/state, e.g.:  
>         [[ e ]] s,t,u = ... mathematical definition ...  
> And one can also use concrete syntax.

Hm, the operational semantics does seem easier for this, but this is a definitional translation. Is it ever conventional to write C |- T[[e]] -> e';E?

I might be wrong, but it seems like `T[[ e ]] s` lets us define a function:

    T : Expr -> Context -> ExprTargetLang

Which propogates Context down, but not back up. But I am looking more for:

    T_plus_context : Expr -> (ExprTargetLang, Context)

Which propogates context back up to the translate function that initially called it.

Would it be possible to just describe the context mechanism narratively?

> Hmm. The example looks a bit peculiar, since m and n are different. It is not clear from the notation whether/how n and m are related and what the result is supposed to be. I know the behavior of zip/zipWith, but that is not apparent from the ellipsis notation. So I would expect this definition to be undefined. IMO, we should only define intuitive/obvious behaviors.  
> In any case, The semantics definition somehow has to reveal that zipWith goes up to min(m,n). This shouldn't be buried in/deferred to the definition of zipWith.  

That makes sense -- I will be more explicit about it.
