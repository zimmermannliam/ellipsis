spj how to write a paper:
1. Start writing first
	* (idea -> writing -> research instead of idea -> research -> writing)
2. Identify your key idea
	* Make it very clear
	* "ping"
3. Tell a story
    * Story:
        * Here is a problem 
        * It's an interesting problem
        * It's an unsolved problem
        * Here is my idea ***
        * My idea works (details, data)
        * Here is how my idea compares to other peoples' approaches
4. Nail your contributions to the mast
    * Examples!
    * Molehills, not mountains
