#favorites inits ```  inits x1 ... xn = (x1 ... x1) ... (x1 ... xn) ```
#favorites sublists

subseqs is hard... Not sure if I can do it as easily as a list comprehension

but sublists is easy:


```haskell
sublists [] = []
sublists (x1 ... xn) = ((x1 ... x1) ... (x1 ... xn)) ++ sublists (x2 ... xn)

-- or 

sublists [] = []
sublists xs = inits xs ++ sublists (drop 1 xs)

but inits is ugly normally I think:
-- A simple implementation of inits that should be obviously correct.
{-# NOINLINE initsR #-}
initsR :: [a] -> [[a]]
initsR = map reverse . scanl (flip (:)) []
-- this is the slower implementation?
inits                   :: [a] -> [[a]]
inits                   = map toListSB . scanl' snocSB emptySB
{-# NOINLINE inits #-}
```
